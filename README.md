challenge from last semester from a professor. i couldn't solve it then because i wasn't aware of the power of the stack.

works okay...
run with `-a ` to sort the operands alphabetically

- supports brackets also


things that you shouldn't do
- run with brackets that are not parentheses

operators are

`"=" BiConditional`,
`">" Implies`,
`"+" Or`,
`"&" And`,
`"~" Not`

all tests runs are confirmed by this
